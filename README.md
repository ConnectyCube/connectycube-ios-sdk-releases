# ConnectyCube SDK

This repository contains releases of the iOS SDK for interacting with the ConnectyCube communications cloud.

It provides a simple interface to the messaging, video calling (WebRTC), push notifications, users management and cloud files storage capabilities provided by the platform. 

[Getting Started with ConnectyCube iOS SDK](https://developers.connectycube.com/ios/)

# Installation

The ConnectyCube iOS SDK can be installed directly into your application by adding sdk libraries via CocoaPods.

Make sure that you have [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) installed.

Open your Podfile and add following line for dynamic framework (iOS 8+):

``` ruby
pod 'ConnectyCube'
```

Then add a "Run Script Phase" in build phases of your project. Past the following snippet in the script:

``` bash
bash "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/Connecty–°ube.framework/strip-framework.sh"
```

This fixes a [known Apple bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216), that does not allowing to publish archives to the App store with dynamic frameworks that contains simulator platforms. Script will only work for archiving.

Then open **Terminal** go to your project folder with Podfile and run:

``` bash
pod install
```

Now you can open **.xcworkspace** file and use ConnectyCube Framework in your project.
